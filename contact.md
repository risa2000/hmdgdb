# Contact

For technical questions and issues related to this site, the best way to
contact me is by using [GitHub issues]({{ site.github.issues_url }}).

For discussions I prefer public forums. I am usually present on [Pimax
forum](https://forum.pimaxvr.com) as @risa2000. From time to time, using the
same nickname, I am also visiting [reddit](https://www.reddit.com), so if you
decide to start a thread about anything from here there, you can summon me as
well.

For private inquiries, or for sending the recorded data, you can contact me at
_risa2000x_ _at_ _gmail_.
