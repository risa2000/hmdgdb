# HMD Geometry Database Changelog

## May 3, 2025

- Added an option to sort the HMD table by a different column (thanks to @greggman).

## April 20, 2025

- PSVR2 (added)
- Fixed the HAM area calculation in `hmdq` and published corrected values here.

Until now the HAM area calculation assumed that all HAMs were specified inside [(0,0), (1,1)] rectangle and _did not check it_. Thus calculating the total mesh area as a plain sum of all triangles' areas.

Some HAMs however overlap slightly the nominal rectangle and the sum of all triangles' areas gives slightly higher value. I thought originally the error would be small, but it turned out that the difference is perceivable.

The affected headsets which were reported in HMDGDB with slightly bigger HAM area, are following:

```python
Oculus Rift CV1 - original: 14.07 %, corrected: 10.03 %
Oculus Rift S   - original: 11.26 %, corrected:  9.25 %
Oculus Quest    - original:  5.69 %, corrected:  3.68 %
Oculus Quest 2  - original:  9.13 %, corrected:  7.12 %
Meta Quest Pro  - original: 14.11 %, corrected: 11.92 %
Meta Quest 3    - original: 12.89 %, corrected: 10.66 %
```

The HMDGDB has been updated to show the correct values now.
